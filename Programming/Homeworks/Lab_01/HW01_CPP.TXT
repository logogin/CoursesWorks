1.26 Write a program that inputs three integers from the keyboard,
and prints the sum, averag, product, smallest and largest of
these numbers. The screen dialogue should appear as follows:
 _______________________________________________________________
|								|
|  Input three different integers: 13 27 14			|
|  Sum is 54							|
|  Average is 18						|
|  Product is 4914						|
|  Smallest is 13						|
|  Largest is 27						|
|_______________________________________________________________|

1.27 There are program that reads in the radius of a circle and
prints the circle's diametr, circumference, and area. Use the
constant value 3.14159 for Pi. Do these calculations in output
statments. (Note: In this chapter, we have discussed only integers
constants and variables. In Chapter 3 we will discuss floating
point numbers, i.e., values that can have decimal points.)

1.30 Write a program that reads in five integers and determines
and prints the lapgest and the smallest integers in the group.
Use only the programming techniques you learned in this chapter.

1.31 Write a program that reads integer and determines and prints
whether it is odd or even. (Hint: Use the modulus operator. An
even number is a multiple of two. Any multiple of two leaves a
remainder of zero when divided by 2.)

1.33 Write a program that reads in two integers and determines and
prints if the first is a multiple of the second.
(Hint: Use the modulus operator.)

1.36 Write a program that inputs a five-digit number, separates the
number into its individual digits.
[ 42339         ]
[ 4 2 3 3 9     ]
